Brady's Site Privacy Policy - because Instagram made me do it

Brady's Site is a personal website displaying information about my career and portfolio. It also displays my personal Instragram feed.

If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact me at bradyscaspar@outlook.com.

Information Collection and Use

I do not collect any user information or data other than my own. This data (my own pictures from my Instagram feed) are not stored. 

Information Sharing and Disclosure
I do not collect or store anyones info other than my own, so there is no sharing or disclosure of your information. Plain and simple. 

Changes to this Policy
I will probably never even look at this policy again so you can expect it to not change. It might if my personal site changes dramatically, but I'll probably create a new site in that case with a new policy much more complicated than this one.

Effective: October 2018
