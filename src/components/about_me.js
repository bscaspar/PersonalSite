After taking time off and traveling around the Pacific North West, climbing and exploring with my girlfriend and new puppy, I settled on a career as a web developer. The future will be an exciting challenge as I explore the latest web technologies and languages. I'm looking forward to learning on a daily basis, to engaging in the design process, and to having the autonomy that lets me live the lifestyle I love.",
