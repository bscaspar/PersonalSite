    p1: "I'm diving into a career in freelance development after five years at Microsoft working as an app developer for a range of Microsoft customers and as a program manager on the Azure team. My experiences building solutions directly for customers and being embedded in the inner workings of Microsoft's cloud platform have given me a unique perspective on how to make technology work for people and business with a diverse range of requirements and ambitions.",
